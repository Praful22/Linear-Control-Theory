# Linear Control Theory ME4236
--> Senior standing course taken at Vanderbilt University during Fall of 2022 taught by Dr.Eric J Barth.

This repository contains a few homeworks done in MATLAB/SIMULINK and the final examination taken for Linear Control Theory ME4236. The repository doesn't cover all the concepts learned in classroom yet it shows major MATLAB/SIMULINK code/block diagrams  that might be helpful to carry out fundamental control analysis of linear dynamic systems.
